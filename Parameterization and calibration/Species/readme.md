###Species

The top 20 occurring species in NC FIA plots were determined using ‘FIA_summaryTM’ script. Of the top 20 species, I decided to use any species that represented greater 
than 2% of occurrences in the FIA data, plus longleaf pine and turkey oak. This decision was made after consulting local experts (David Schnake, former NC forester and 
current NCSU PhD student, and Jen Costanza (US Forest Service research who has conducted research in my study area). I asked them both if the list was representative of 
the species typically found on the ground in my landscape, whether the cutoff of species about 2% was appropriate, and whether any crucial species were left off of the 
top 20 list or from the list of species above 2%. Both noted that longleaf pine and turkey oak were missing from both lists and were a crucial part of the sandhills ecosystem 
of NC (occurs on Ft. Bragg). This is a small but distinct portion of my study extent and biologically very different from the piedmont area of the rest of the study area so 
I decided to include these two species. In total, my list of species to model includes 11 species (4 pines, 2 oaks, 5 misc. hardwoods): Pinus taeda	(loblolly pine), Liquidamber 
styraciflua	(sweetgum), Acer rubrum	(red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), Pinus echinata (shortleaf pine), Quercus alba	(white oak), Cornus florida	(flowering 
dogwood), Oxydendrum arboreum	(sourwood), Pinus virginiana (virginia pine), Pinus palustris	(longleaf pine), and Quercus laevis	(turkey oak).

To find input values for each of these species in the species input file, I consulted the literature, past LANDIS-II projects, FEIS, and the silvics manual along with 
a few miscellaneous sources. For species txt sources, see TM May10.xlsx.
