We simulated four protected area network development strategies derived from four conservation theories described in the literature and enacted by conservation 
and land management agencies globally (Murdoch et al. 2007, Burkey 1989, Hjort et al. 2015). These strategies are: Economic, emphasizing that economic costs should be balanced
with intended biodiversity benefits when evaluating conservation action; Cluster, emphasizing protected area development around already established conservation cores;
Geodiversity, emphasizing the acquisition of land with the highest geodiversity characteristics; and Opportunistic, representing the ad hoc nature of land acquisition that can
sometimes occur when a parcel becomes unexpectedly available for conservation acqusition.

This folder contains information on the conservation strategies simulated.
