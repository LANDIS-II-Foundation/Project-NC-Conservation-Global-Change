To understand the influence of land use change on landscape connectivity, we used two scenarios came from the EPA’s Integrated Climate and Land-Use Scenarios (ICLUS) v2.1.1. 
The ICLUS projects spatially explicit population and land-use changes based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scenarios and RCPs. Shared socioeconomic 
pathway 2 (SSP2) represents a middle of the road land use change scenario in which population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. SSP5 
represents a scenario in which strong market forces and technological progress support both economic and social development leading to greater population growth and urban 
expansion. These land use change projections can be found at https://www.epa.gov/gcx/iclus-downloads
