### Hurricanes

We simulated hurricanes using the Base Hurricane extension, parameterized for North Carolina (Schrum et al. 2020). We used parameters developed for the Southeastern United States 
(Schrum et al. 2020). Schrum et al. (2020) obtained hurricane data for storms occurring on the coast of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia from 1969 to 2018 
from the National Hurricane Centerâ€™s Best Track Data (HURDAT2). They then used HURDAT2 data to derive estimates of storm frequency, wind field size, maximum sustained wind speed,
and storm size. Each simulated storm has a storm track direction and generates a maximum wind speed at landfall. Cohort mortalities depend on those maximum sustained wind speeds 
and vary by species (Schrum et al. 2020). Where data were missing in the literature or not found in Schrum et al. (2020), we used taxonomic analogs. This was necessary for 3
species: Cornus florida, Oxydendrum arboreum, and Pinus virginiana. To reflect the increased frequency and severity of hurricanes expected under climate change, storm occurrence 
probabilities and mortality probabilities increased in accordance with unpublished work by Schrum and others.
