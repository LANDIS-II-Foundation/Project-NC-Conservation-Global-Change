# Project-NC-Conservation-Global-Change

### Project Overview
Central North Carolina is an exceptionally active region for conservation. Containing the portions of the Atlantic Coastal Plain ecoregion, a global biodiversity hotspot (Noss et al. 2015); the Sandhills ecoregion, a hub of interagency conservation efforts to restore longleaf pine forests (Brockway et al. 2005); and the Piedmont ecoregion, where the Uwharrie National Forest has become the focus of longterm restoration planning (US Forest Service 2012); this area is of substantial interest to conservation NGOs and natural resource agencies across all levels of government.
