#### Functional groups
After consulting with Rob, we decided on 4 functional groups. A pines group (loblolly, shortleaf, and longleaf), a group solely for Virginia pine (because Virginia pine has a 
range that extends further north than the other pines and can tolerate much colder temperatures), a hardwoods group (white oak, sweet gum, red maple, yellow poplar, flowering 
dogwood, and sourwood), and a group solely for turkey oak (while white oak is a generalist, turkey oak only exists in the southern portion of white oakâ€™s range and has temperature 
and precipitation limit differences). Of the hardwoods functional group, sourwood has a more narrow range but it is still well within the range of the other 
species in this functional group and it has similar temperature and precipitation limitations.
