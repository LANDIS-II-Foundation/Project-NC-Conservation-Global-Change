### Conservation Strategies

We simulated four protected area network development strategies derived from four conservation theories described in the literature and enacted by conservation 
and land management agencies globally (Murdoch et al. 2007, Burkey 1989, Hjort et al. 2015). These strategies are: Economic, emphasizing that economic costs should be balanced
with intended biodiversity benefits when evaluating conservation action; Cluster, emphasizing protected area development clustered around already established conservation cores;
Geodiversity, emphasizing the acquisition of land with the highest geodiversity characteristics; and Opportunistic, representing the ad hoc nature of land acquisition that can
sometimes occur when a parcel becomes unexpectedly available for conservation acqusition.

Prior to testing our strategies, we conducted a sensitivity test examining what area of land conservation was necessary to demonstrate differences in landscape connectivity. 
Based on this sensitivity test, we choose to conserve roughly one percent of the total landscape area at each 5-year time step, resulting in approximately 17 percent of 
total land conserved over 80 years. Already conserved lands, identified using the Protected Areas database from the US Geological Survey, were not considered for land 
acquisition. Areas identified as open water or as high, medium, or low density residential in the NLCD (2016) were also removed from consideration. Habitat was allowed to 
grow and mature over time reflecting the change in habitat quality as trees developed and matured.
