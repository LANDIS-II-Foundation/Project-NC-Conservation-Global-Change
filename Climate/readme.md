Climate

Baseline historical climate data for all business-as-usual scenarios were downloaded as daily averages of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind speed 
from the USGS geodataportal. For all climate change scenarios, climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 downscaled using the 
Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method were downloaded from the Climatology Lab at the University of California Merced (NKN Thredd server). 
We chose five general circulation models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 that bracketed the temperature and precipitation projections for 
the study area: bcc-csm1, CNRM-CM5, Had-GEM2, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and Nor-ESM1-M (Gray 2019). Climate data were downloaded as monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum 
temperature, and wind speed and processed by LANDIS-IIâ€™s climate library. 

We decided on only one climate region for the study area because of the relatively flat topography and only minor variation in precipitation across the study area.
