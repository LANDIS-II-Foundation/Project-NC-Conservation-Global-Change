### Biomass Harvest

#### Management and stand maps
The management map was taken directly from the Forest Service Forest Ownership Types in the Conterminous US map (https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/rmap/rmap_nrs6.pdf). This map was 
reprojected to the extent of my study area.


For the stand map, I took the management map and subdivided it by a roads and streams layer to create individual forest stands. I originally only subdivide by major roads and 
streams layers but this yielded stands that were far too large. I had to redo the subdivision, this time by all roads and all streams on my landscape to create smaller stands. 
This was done in ArcGIS and then had to be reprojected in R similar to the management area map.
Stand size was validated with data from Rajan Parajuli- NC-wide land and forest holdings data from 2017-2018 from NWOS survey
