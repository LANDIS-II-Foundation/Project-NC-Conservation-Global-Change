### Study extent	

The project study extent was decided by consulting with Rob Scheller and Alec Kretchun, looking for a large enough landscape here in NC to be appropriate for analysis 
without being so large that it’s computationally difficult or exceedingly time consuming to process. It started as a desire to partner with Rob’s Department of Defense 
project on Ft. Bragg and have the technical support/expertise of Alec and some of the other project resources at my disposal, so the study extent needed to incorporate 
the Ft. Bragg landscape. From there, I extended it out west to include the Uwharrie National Forest. The goal was to encompass substantial portions of both the sandhills 
and piedmont ecoregions within my study extent. The edges of the study extent were determined by a desire to avoid urban cores and the knowledge that roads act as good fire 
breaks, an important point of note on a landscape so dependent on fire. The study extent is bounded by major roads and Raleigh, Greensboro, Charlotte, and the NC/SC state border.
The study extent was designated by using Google maps and dragging cursor around pieces of the landscape, looking for major roads and trying to leave out largely urban areas.
